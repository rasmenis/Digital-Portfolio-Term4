## 🗂️ 1. Business Communication – Reflection 
###  Situation
As part of the **Work Readiness**, I completed a **Business Communication assessment** designed to test my understanding of key communication principles used in professional environments. The activity focused on **formal language, tone in emails, non-verbal communication,** and **virtual meeting etiquette**, all of which are essential skills for workplace success.

###  Task
My objective was to demonstrate my ability to identify appropriate communication methods and behaviors for different business settings. This included recognizing the difference between **formal and informal communication**, applying the correct **tone** in professional messages, and understanding how **body language** and **presentation** impact communication in virtual meetings.

###  Action
To complete this activity, I carefully read each question and applied the principles learned during the work readiness training.  
I reviewed examples of professional emails, learned the importance of non-verbal cues such as **eye contact** and **posture**, and practiced identifying when formal language is necessary in workplace interactions.  
I also reflected on past experiences at **Plum Systems**, where effective communication helped me collaborate with my supervisor and other developers. By taking the assessment, I reinforced my knowledge of how to maintain professionalism in both written and verbal communication.

###  Result
Through this activity, I gained a stronger understanding of how **effective communication builds trust and clarity** in the workplace.  
I learned to adapt my tone and language to suit different audiences and situations, ensuring that messages are always clear and respectful.  
This knowledge now helps me communicate confidently with team members and clients at **Plum Systems**, where collaboration and clarity are vital in every project.
