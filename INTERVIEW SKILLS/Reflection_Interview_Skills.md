# Interview Skills – Reflection (STAR Technique)

## Situation
As part of the **Work Readiness and Professional Development** module, I completed an **Interview Skills assessment** aimed at improving my understanding of how to prepare for and perform effectively during job interviews. The activity focused on important areas such as **interview purpose, the CAR method, company research, self-introduction techniques,** and **how to handle difficult questions** like discussing weaknesses.

## Task

## Action
To complete this activity, I reviewed each question carefully and applied the principles learned during the interview preparation lessons.  
I practiced forming structured answers using the **CAR technique**, which helped me describe my experiences clearly and with confidence.  
I also studied how to tailor answers for different questions, for example, presenting weaknesses honestly while showing self-improvement.  
Additionally, I learned how to research a company’s values, culture, and goals before an interview to align my answers with what employers are looking for.

I now understand the importance of preparation and self-awareness during interviews, and I feel more confident in responding to challenging questions. This exercise strengthened my readiness to engage in professional interviews with clarity, confidence, and composure.
