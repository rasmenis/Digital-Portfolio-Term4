## 🗂️ 2. Interview Skills – Reflection 

###  Situation
I completed an **Interview Skills assessment** aimed at evaluating my understanding of effective interview techniques.  
The assessment focused on preparing for interviews, researching companies, answering common interview questions, and using the **CAR method (Context, Action, Result)** to structure responses.

###  Task
My objective was to demonstrate my ability to prepare for and respond confidently in job interviews.  
This included understanding the purpose of interviews, researching companies beforehand, answering questions such as *“Tell me about yourself”*, and discussing my strengths and weaknesses professionally.

###  Action
To complete this activity, I practiced answering typical interview questions using the **CAR method**, ensuring that my responses were clear and structured.  
I also researched the importance of understanding a company’s values and operations before attending an interview, which helps tailor answers to the employer’s expectations.  
During my internship at **Plum Systems**, I applied these principles when preparing for feedback sessions and presenting project updates, and treating them as mini interviews where clear, confident communication was essential.

###  Result
This activity improved my confidence in professional interviews and in presenting myself as a capable software developer.  
I learned to express my skills clearly, maintain professionalism, and use structured responses to demonstrate competence.  
These skills have translated directly into my daily interactions at **Plum Systems**, where I regularly explain technical work in meetings and code reviews.
