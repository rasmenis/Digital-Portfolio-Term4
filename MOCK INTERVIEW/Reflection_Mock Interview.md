## üóÇÔ∏è 3. Mock Interview ‚Äì Reflection 

###  Situation
I recorded a **Mock Interview video** to practice and demonstrate my interview skills in a simulated environment.  
The activity focused on **preparing responses to common interview questions, practicing professional communication,** and presenting myself confidently on camera, simulating a real interview experience.

###  Task
My goal was to demonstrate the ability to **respond confidently and professionally** during an interview scenario.  
This included applying the **CAR method (Context, Action, Result)** to structure my answers, using professional language, and maintaining positive body language throughout the interview.

###  Action
To complete this activity, I planned and rehearsed my answers to typical interview questions, ensuring that each response followed the CAR framework.  
I recorded myself delivering the answers, focusing on **tone, posture, and clarity**.  
After reviewing the video, I identified areas for improvement, such as **eye contact** and **pacing**, and refined my performance.  
At **Plum Systems**, I apply similar self-evaluation techniques when doing sprint reviews or demonstrating completed features, ensuring my communication is confident and concise.

###  Result
This activity gave me practical experience in presenting myself professionally and communicating clearly under pressure.  
I learned how to stay composed and express my ideas confidently, which has strengthened my ability to handle client discussions and technical presentations at **Plum Systems**.
