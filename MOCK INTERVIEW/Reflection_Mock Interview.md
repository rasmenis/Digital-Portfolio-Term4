# Mock Interview â€“ Reflection (STAR Technique)

## Situation
As part of the **Work Readiness**, I recorded a **Mock Interview video** to practice and demonstrate my interview skills in a simulated environment.  
The activity focused on **preparing responses to common interview questions, practicing professional communication,** and **presenting myself confidently on camera**, simulating a real interview experience.

## Task
My goal was to demonstrate the ability to **respond confidently and professionally** during an interview scenario, even without a live interviewer.  
This included applying the **CAR method (Context, Action, Result)** to structure my answers, using clear and professional language, and maintaining positive body language throughout the video.

## Action
To complete this activity, I planned and rehearsed my answers to typical interview questions, ensuring that each response followed the **CAR framework**. I recorded myself delivering the answers, paying attention to **tone of voice, posture, facial expressions, and clarity**. Afterward, I reviewed my video to identify areas for improvement, such as **pacing, eye contact with the camera,** and **concise delivery of answers**.  
This self-evaluation allowed me to refine my performance and reflect professionalism and confidence.

## Result
Through this activity, I gained **practical experience in presenting myself professionally in an interview format**, even without a live interviewer. I learned how to **structure responses clearly, communicate confidently on camera,** and maintain professional body language and tone.  
This exercise strengthened my **self-awareness and readiness for real interviews**, ensuring I can present myself effectively in both live and virtual interview settings.
